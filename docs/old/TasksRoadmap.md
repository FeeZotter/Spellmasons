As a follow up to https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MwVPXINi27snarC922hPczfOX_OnlthyJfMlIcJ-HE/edit
This document lays out some concrete tasks and a rough timeline.

## Concrete Tasks
- New Systems
    - Auras (complex)
        - onEnter
        - onExit
        - Graphics via Shader or particles
    - Momentum
    - Armor?
- New Spells
    - A variety of Aura spells

    - Empower (easy)
    - Enfeeble (easy)
    - Execution
    - Merge (complex)
    - Meteor
    - Polymorph (complex)
        - Since I love for Spellmasons to suprise people, if players are chaotic enough to self-cast polymorph I think they should be allowed to use the abilities of the unit that they poly into.  Maybe even give them hidden stat upgrades (like upgrading damage).  This would be a very rewarding suprise.  It would also have to disable or remove their regular spells (until they purify to unpolymorph)
    - Recall (super cool)
    - Shatter (easy)
    - Soul Bind (complex)
    - Soul Shard (complex)
    - Spike Pit (may need art, how is this different from trap)
    - Stomp (easy)
    - Target Cursed (medium)
    - Target Injured (easy)
    - Bolt (complex graphics)
    - Last Will 2
        - This should bring back stacking so you can do rediculous potion drops
    - Poison 2
    - Suffocate 2
- New Unit
    - Guru
        - This unit's moves need to be discussed still

    - GeForce screen capture
    - Speedrun.com

    - Unlocks?
    At this point I think the game will be quite stable and so I think we'll need to have a larger discussion about the grand / final vision for the game.  I'd like to be careful with feature creep - so as to not just keep piling on features, but instead to "put a bow on it", in essence to finalize the spirit of the game nicely (leaving room for expansion if wanted) but so that it feels like a cohesive experience.
