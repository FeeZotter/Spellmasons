As a follow up to https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MwVPXINi27snarC922hPczfOX_OnlthyJfMlIcJ-HE/edit
This document lays out some concrete tasks and a rough timeline.

## Concrete Tasks
- New Systems
    - Auras (complex)
        - onEnter
        - onExit
        - Graphics via Shader or particles
    - Momentum
    - Armor?
- New Spells
    - A variety of Aura spells
    - Alchemize (easy)
        - Converts a potion into a random other potion
    - Empower (easy)
        - A blessing that makes a unit deal more damage
    - Enfeeble (easy)
        - A curse that makes a unit deal less damage
    - Execute
        - A damage spell that insta-kills a unit under a certain health threshold.  Stacks increase the threshold
        - This may need some work to feel different from "Bleed"
    - Merge (complex)
        - Merges two units together, summing their stats
        - This will be tricky, how will it interact if used on a Spellmason?  Maybe it only impacts current health / mana instead of max?
    - Meteor
        - Meteor falls on top of enemies doing spash damage around them
    - Polymorph (complex)
        - Changes a unit into another random unit
        - Since I love for Spellmasons to suprise people, if players are chaotic enough to self-cast polymorph I think they should be allowed to use the abilities of the unit that they poly into.  Maybe even give them hidden stat upgrades (like upgrading damage).  This would be a very rewarding suprise.  It would also have to disable or remove their regular spells (until they purify to unpolymorph)
        - Basically the idea is to pleasantly suprise.  If you so choose to turn yourself or your ally spellmason into an archer, I'd expect you to then only have arrow spells and be able to play a "hidden game" of Spellmasons as an Archer instead of a wizard.
        - If you poly into a golem, you'll only have a "bite" attack.  Yes, super limiting but therein lies the pleasant suprise.  It's the natural consequence of polymorphing yourself and I think players will love it.
        - Also it being reversable via purify will make the mistake more hilarious and forgivable in multiplayer (provided you have it)
    - Recall (super cool)
        - A movement spell that creates a mark on the ground, if the mark already exists you teleport to that mark
    - Shatter (easy)
        - A damage spell that deals lots of damage if the enemy is frozen.  If Shatter kills the enemy, it unleashes ice shards in all directions
        - Requires 'Freeze'
    - Soul Bind (complex)
        - A curse, enemies connected with Soul Bind split the damage that they receive between all bound units
        - I'm super excited about this one
    - Soul Shard (medium)
        - The caster splits a piece of their soul into the target.  When the target takes damage so does the caster, but if the caster dies, they will reincarnate in the body of the shard-haver
        - This should be do-able with modifiers
    - Spike Pit (may need art, how is this different from trap)
        - Deals damage on a unit when they enter or cross through it
        - We could use "Aura" system for this to differentiate it from the trap Pickup
    - Stomp (easy)
        - A movement spell that takes all units in a radius around you and thrusts them away
    - Target Curse (medium)
        - A curse that makes the next cast spell also target the cursed unit
    - Target Injured (easy)
        - A spell that adds a unit with less than maximum health to the targeted list.
    - Bolt (complex graphics)
    - Last Will 2
        - This should bring back stacking so you can do rediculous potion drops
    - Poison 2
    - Suffocate 2
- New Unit
    - Guru
        - This unit's moves need to be discussed still
- Refactors
    - Turn Phase
    - AI State machine
        - Ally AI controls (send orders to allies like "follow me" or "retreat")
- UI
    - Inventory bookmarks
- Marketing
    - New Trailer
    - In-game boss introductions
    - New Cover Art
    - Steam Workshop integration
    - GeForce screen capture
    - Speedrun.com

    At this point I think the game will be quite stable and so I think we'll need to have a larger discussion about the grand / final vision for the game.  I'd like to be careful with feature creep - so as to not just keep piling on features, but instead to "put a bow on it", in essence to finalize the spirit of the game nicely (leaving room for expansion if wanted) but so that it feels like a cohesive experience.
