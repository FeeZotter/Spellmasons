## Tuesday
- Figure out WFC walls, floor and liquid with linesegments and bounds
    - LEFT OFF: Integrate inside corner pieces
    - Send examples to Che with appropriate sizes
## Tasks
2. Liquid interactions
    - Apply liquid impact and submerge shader when units "fall in"
3. Rework unit crowding
------
- Idea: Use css blend mode on cards to have a "dark" version and a "light" version depending on if the spell is good or evil.
- Bug: unit animation stops after unit nsync?
- Content: AOE clone should work for pickups
- Bug: Clone doesn't show cloned units until they move cause they spawn right on top of each other
- Bug: clear tooltip on enter portal?? not sure if necessary, tooltip remained while I was manually calling initLevel
- Show modifiers in UI somehow, not just on player, especially when you have the modifier on you
- Critical, polish, robustness: Protect against hit looplimit, if it happens, it's a bad map and must be regenerated
- Bug: There was a bug that ended my game though. I got shield buffed by a resurrected priest, and my character disappeared. this all happened on the turn when the portal appeared (finished the level). Now I cant walk through the portal
I'm getting the empty stamina message when I try to move my (invisible) player
i can still cast spells during my turn; as well as end turns
- Content: Spell that increases cast range, or upgrade
- Bug: Sometimes grunt animations just stop
- Task: An ally that has died at all (even if ressed) should lose their upgrade priviledge
- Task: Better shaders for lava?
- **!**Fix host alt-tabbing issue
- Bug: When you pull a guy and he actually gets to you, and then you move, you "carry" him
- Content: Time crystal releases something when it breaks
- Fix: Brad cast a spell out of range, but it still triggered on my screen
- Hoist spells
    - Logic to avoid fizzle spells
        - Don't cast res on no dead
        - do this by hoisting and checking pre-cast
        - How to resurrect units you are standing on top of (blocking?)
---
- More random generation / better maps.  This isn't a rogue-like without the random element
    - Take queues from slay the spire
    - Sectors could have optional elements
    - Sectors could fit together using WFC instead of just being picked by random
    - Interesting Parts of levels
        - choke points
        - pickups
        - hiding places
        - 2 ways to get somewhere
        - traps that trigger things

- Content: An enemy that pulls you into danger
- Content: "Orge" enemies that get stronger for every ally of theirs that dies
- Bug: Pathing broken on seed 0.5727148663470687 
    - it ran into `Hit loopLimit for polygon processing.  May be an infinite loop or the polygon may just be too big.`
    - In this case it should just abort that level and try a new one
- Bug: Should sync portals when syncing units if all enemies are dead
- Bug: Portal didn't appear once (honeycomb seems broken if you have walls above and below you)
- Bug: Goons spawned outside of map when summoner was stuffed in upper left corner of map

---
- Make damage that they WILL take different from damage that they HAVE taken.  It's confusing

- Bug: Had a scenario where i had a debugger on enterPortal and on image.show
and 2nd client got `Cannot change character, player not found with id 8c502be8-631c-482a-9398-40155f77c21f`
    - maybe in this case, re-request player sync??
- Improve sending castCards with targeting based on id not position
- Make loading screen
- Make an overlay screen that blocks interaction while waiting for sync
- Unit movement desync occurred between clients when one client has CPU throttled, the non throttled client has the unit move much farther

# Stale, but important bugs

- The zoom coordinates off issue between multiplayer sessions when casting
    - hit on one screen, miss on another
