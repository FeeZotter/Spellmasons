## Matt Ideas

- Spell pool (3 spells that you channel and build up over time)
- Both players share common deck to pick cards from
  - at the beginning of each turn, they are presented with 8 cards and they pick one at a time until they've each picked 3 which they can apply to spells they're summoning
- Some super powerful cards have secondary negative effects which trigger as soon as you pick them (spawns a golem on your side)
- Golems spawn randomly (not controlled by the players) (they foil your plans)
- (maybe) the more damaged your opponent is the more golums come your way (blue shell)
- Spells fire in a line

Game phases:

- Pick (both players apply "cards" to their spells (one at a time alternating))
- NPC (golems spawn and/or advance)
- Cast (players cast one at a time)

## Elements

Elements as building blocks for combined spells:

- time
- position
  - Aura / AOE
  - Adjacent
- state
  - wet / poisoned / etc
- unit attribute
  - e.g. health, strength, etc
    - e.g. has effect relative to health remaining
- movement / collision
- random chances

## Plan

- Iterate as much as possible through playtesting
- Refactor as necessary to keep the codebase robust and simple to work in
