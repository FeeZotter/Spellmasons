## Bugs
- Clone can put units out of bounds
- Note: flying projectile race timeouts happened on alttab on dev
- bug: Best Spell on game over screen is bugged
- In multiplayer if you spawn in someone else's portal it goes away and you have to end your turn twice for it to come back

    pathing bug
    If you start a summon-swarm against a enemy on the opposite side of a U-path or similar, as far as I can tell its inevitable that some of the units will start to walk through the wall.
    might be tied to priest summoning some units since they are always there when I see this, but might be coincidence.
- bug: menu-UI; I still get "unable to connect" doesn't clear even after you connect in multiplayer
- bug: Enemies that will die next turn due to curses like poison shouldn't show that they will attack you next turn with attack badge
- UI: Fix order of spells in codex and inventory

Hello, 

Sorry I attempted to record my bug but my recording software leaves up the spellbook for the entirety of the recording
anyways, more accurately after testing a couple times. Deathmasons just cause major "lag" actions can take multiple minutes to resolve, this is without pressing end turn. This happens every time deathmasons are in my game. Funny enough pressing ESC or alt-tabbing causes the actions to resolve quickly.n
so desync was not the correct term for my single-player issue
The actions of the player (my actions) take a long time to resolve. 

The deathmasons work fine. 

I only experience the bug on the level with the deathmasons

After a wipe and restart, is it intended that players start with more than three spells?

Happened to me once

It happens to me all the time, but it's really inconsistent. Sometimes I get four spells, once I got 20
I can't tell whether this is intended or not

question and possible bug when me and my friend die and restart a game it seems that sometimes we'll start with the regular 3 spells and sometimes we'll start with a very high number of spells and the ability to start with a class
