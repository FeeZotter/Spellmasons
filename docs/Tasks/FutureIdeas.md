# Ideas
- ice wall (empty unit with `immovable` to true and ice image)
- Glass axe
- Auras or growing / moving areas on the map that do damage onEndTurn
- invincible enemy that does damage that forces you to stay mobile
- Mana expensive spell that gets stronger the more you use it (resets every level)
- Auras
    - fog of war (on branch fogOfWar)

## Unit
- Squid enemy that lives in liquid
    - DigitalVaporeon / Zed9876: Squid enemy that lives in liquid
- an enemy that dies when all it's allies are dead
- an enemy that does more damage the more alone it is
- Idea: enemy that only takes damage while in liquid
    - DigitalVaporeon
- Idea: monster that grows stronger over time

## Spell
- Explosion where the closer you are to the center, the more damage it does
- Enemies have their hp shared between them when near eachother. So you hit 4 enemies clumped together it will split the damage between all of them. @Skillo
    if you want to snipe one gotta isolate them
    Or invulnerable when grouped??
- Target Injured Enemies spell
- A way to share mana or send to friends @meme_man

Imagine u connect 10 corps or dead ennemy/summon  you summon a "bone golem" for exemple lvl 10 if you have 5 dead body it's a bone golem lvl 5 etc

## Modifier
- enigmaticbacon: Paperweight, heavyweight
    - Add mass to units
        - Some units automatically have more mass than others like bosses

## Pickup
- potion effects happen over a couple of turns, but are stronger @Skillo
- Pickup that thrusts you in a direction (may interefere with attack calculations with enemies)
